The chemistry search stack. Index chemical structures, including arbitrary extra properties. Fast to search and your callers don't need RDKit.

 * RDkit provides the smarts
 * Rust provides the type safety and relative ease of use

See [rdkit-sys](https://github.com/turues/rdkit-sys) for more on how the bindings work.
